          <p>
            Right now, I am interested in learning how to develop for iOS. I'm
            developing a card game in Swift/SwiftUI that I hope to put on the
            AppStore to play with friends. It uses Firebase Firestore as the
            backend and updates player's data in real time by utilizing Swift's
            Combine framework and custom Publishers. Coming from a background in
            React, it also features a Redux-like state management system with a
            global store, reducers, and actions.
          </p>

            Fun Activities
          </h2>
          <p>
            I'm a big fan of any outdoor activities and being outside in
            general. Whether it's just sittting on my balcony when the weather
            is nice, or going for a run, hike, bike ride, etc. Since I spend so
            much time on my computer as a full time student and software
            engineering intern, I try to stay relatively active in my free time.
            Unfortunately, I live in Wisconsin so that makes things more
            difficult. In the winter though, I snowboard.
